  "summary": "Analysis detected 0 anomalies. Primary diagnosis: - Anomaly count: 0 (no anomalies detected)\n- Feature categories analyzed include statistical, distributional, and temporal features of the vibration signal from Motor-001 at RPM 1750.\n- Sample rate is set to analyze data with a frequency resolution suitable for capturing high-frequency components in motor operation signals (sample_rate: 10000 Hz).\n- The original filename of the dataset used as input was 'manu.json'.\n- Data sources are not specified, which may limit our understanding of potential external factors affecting signal quality or originating issues within Motor-001 itself.\n",

        "Potential issues could arise from imbalance, misalignment, bearing wear, unsuitable lubrication levels, temperature variations affecting material properties of components (like thermal expansion), and electrical supply inconsistencies causing torque ripple effects on the motor's vibration signature."
