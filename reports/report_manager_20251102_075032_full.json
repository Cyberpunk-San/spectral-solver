    "summary": "Diagnosis: - Anomaly Count: 7 anomalies detected across the dataset for Motor-001 at rpm of 1750 with a sample rate of 10,000 readings per second. These findings are based on statistical and distributional analysis within vibration signals as well as temperature data points that deviate from expected patterns or thresholds.\n- Machine ID: Motor-001 is the machine under investigation for these anomalies which could indicate a localized issue with this specific unit rather than an industry-wide problem, assuming other machines operate normally without similar issues.\n- Signal Type and Data Source Information Unavailable: The original filename \"dataset.csv\" suggests that data was likely time series in nature but the file analysis section does not provide information on its type or source reliability which is critical for a thorough investigation.\n. Business Impact: Medium - Schedule maintenance soon",
