        "The lack of anomalies detected suggests that the system is functioning within normal parameters at this point; however, without temporal pattern data and severity distribution information, it's challenging to identify specific root causes for fluct0urations or deviations in performance over time.",
        "Potential issues could arise from imbalance, misalignment, bearing wear, unsuitable lubrication levels, temperature variations affecting material properties of components (like thermal expansion), and electrical supply inconsistencies causing torque ripple effects on the motor's vibration signature."
